# Book-recommendation-system
This program sorts the books(data from Goodreads) into clusters and automatically suggests high-rated books based on the clusters containing the input book
from the user. The program will be able to take in user feedback for dissatisfied books in the list, and refresh the suggestion list every time it receives the feedback. 
This program uses python's tkinter package (“Tk interface”) to create GUI windows of finding clusters, finding recommended list of books.
